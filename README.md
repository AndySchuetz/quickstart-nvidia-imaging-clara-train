# Deploying the NVIDIA Clara Train SDK with Amazon ECS, Amazon EFS, AWS CloudFormation, and an Application Load Balancer

This reference architecture provides a set of YAML templates for deploying the Clara Train SDK as a highly availible service.

## Overview

The [NVIDIA Clara Train SDK](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/) includes AI-Assisted Annotation APIs and Annotation server that can be seamlessly integrated into any medical viewer making them AI capable. The training framework includes decentralized learning techniques like federated learning and transfer learning. The SDK also makes available model applications packaged as MMARS (Medical Model ARchive) available to users, providing an intuitive config based environment for data scientists and researchers to get kick-started with AI development.

The repository consists of a set of nested templates that deploy the following:

- A tiered [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) with public and private subnets, spanning an AWS region.
- A highly available ECS cluster deployed across two [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in an [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group and that are AWS SSM enabled.
- A pair of [NAT gateways](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (one in each zone) to handle outbound traffic.
- An [Elastic File System](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/) to persist data used by containers.
- A single instance of the Clara Train SDK container, deployed as an [ECS service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) (clara-service). 
- An [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) to the public subnets to handle inbound traffic.

## Why use AWS CloudFormation with Amazon ECS?

Using CloudFormation to deploy and manage services with ECS has a number of nice benefits over more traditional methods ([AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli), scripting, etc.). 

#### Infrastructure-as-Code

A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).  Templates are simple YAML- or JSON-formatted text files that can be placed under your normal source control mechanisms, stored in private or public locations such as Amazon S3, and exchanged via email. With CloudFormation, you can see exactly which AWS resources make up a stack. You retain full control and have the ability to modify any of the AWS resources created as part of a stack. 

#### Self-documenting 

Fed up with outdated documentation on your infrastructure or environments? Still keep manual documentation of IP ranges, security group rules, etc.?

With CloudFormation, your template becomes your documentation. Want to see exactly what you have deployed? Just look at your template. If you keep it in source control, then you can also look back at exactly which changes were made and by whom.

#### Intelligent updating & rollback

CloudFormation not only handles the initial deployment of your infrastructure and environments, but it can also manage the whole lifecycle, including future updates. During updates, you have fine-grained control and visibility over how changes are applied, using functionality such as [change sets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-change-sets-for-aws-cloudformation/), [rolling update policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html) and [stack policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html).

## Template details

The templates below are included in this repository and reference architecture:

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| [master.yaml](master.yaml) | This is the master template - deploy it to CloudFormation and it includes all of the others automatically. |
| [infrastructure/vpc.yaml](infrastructure/vpc.yaml) | This template deploys a VPC with a pair of public and private subnets spread across two Availability Zones. It deploys an [Internet gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html), with a default route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT gateways (one in each zone), and default routes for them in the private subnets. |
| [infrastructure/security-groups.yaml](infrastructure/security-groups.yaml) | This template contains the [security groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) required by the entire stack. They are created in a separate nested template, so that they can be referenced by all of the other nested templates. |
| [infrastructure/efs.yaml](infrastructure/efs.yaml) | This template deploys an Elastic File System in each subnet covered by the the ECS autoscaling group. |
| [infrastructure/load-balancers.yaml](infrastructure/load-balancers.yaml) | This template deploys an ALB to the public subnets, which exposes the various ECS services. It is created in in a separate nested template, so that it can be referenced by all of the other nested templates and so that the various ECS services can register with it. |
| [infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml](infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml) | This template deploys an ECS cluster to the private subnets using an Auto Scaling group and installs the AWS SSM agent with related policy requirements. |
| [services/service.yaml](services/service.yaml) | This template deployes an instance of the Clara Train SDK as an ECS service.|

After the CloudFormation templates have been deployed, the [stack outputs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html) contain a link to the load-balanced URL for the deployed Clara Train service and the DNS name of the EFS.

The ECS instances should also appear in the Managed Instances section of the EC2 console.
